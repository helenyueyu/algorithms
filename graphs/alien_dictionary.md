## Overview

A few things to keep in mind: 

* The letters **within** a word don't tell us anything about the relative order. The word `kitten` doesn't tell us `k` precedes `i`. 
* If we have a prefix and a prefix followed by some letters, the prefix should occur first (e.g. `ab`, `abcd`). 
* There can be more than one valid alphabet ordering. 
* Output ordering should contain **all letters** in the given input, and no additional letters.
