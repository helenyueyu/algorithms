# Algorithms

## Dijkstra's
Shortest path from **one** node to all nodes - time `O(n^2)`

## Bellman-Ford
Shortest path from **one** node to all nodes, negative edges **allowed**

## Floyd-Warshall
Shortest path between **all** pairs of vertices, negativeedges **allowed**
    * Running Dijkstra's with each node - time complexity is `O(n^3)`
